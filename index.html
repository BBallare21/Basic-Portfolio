                <p>
                    I am married to my wonderful wife Rebecca and we have a 9 month old son named Luca. 
                    I used to work at an automotive shop that specialized in modified components. 
                    I enjoyed it for a long time, 
                    though eventually the hours started to get to me and I began to enjoy it less every day. 
                    That was when I decided to go back to school, 
                    receiving my B.S. in Marketing just a short while ago. 
                    My wife on the other hand had an inkling that I would not enjoy marketing as much as I would in web development. I looked at many coding bootcamps and found the one at UCLA best suited my needs. 
                    So here I am looking to change careers again and provide a better life for my family.
